Notes for Model:
1. minimum_nights and maximum_nights are causing training curve to have spikes because of their large values. Should either normalize or remove.
2. For xxx_df = pd.concat(frames, sort=False): change from sort=True to sort=False
3. In dataloader, shuffle=False for easier analysis.
4. In dataloader, num_workers=0 for windows
5. Learning rate can be increased to say ~0.01 or 0.001 
6. For statistics printing:
   - change if i % 10 == 0 to == 9
   - change print("..." % (i, ...)) to print("..." % (i+1, ...))

(removed minimum_nights and maximum_nights)
